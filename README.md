Hi Everyone!

This is a blog website where you can create and read your blog files and posts. 
This was a task assigned to me while working as an intern at BharatIntern. 
This was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
It enhanced my knowledge in the domain of web development ensuring that I grow well as a developer.
